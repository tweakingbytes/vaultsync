# VaultSync
A program to encrypt files/directories and store them on a removable storage device.

## Background
This project was created while I was travelling for an extended period of time and had no safe mechanism for keeping archives of my files. I could not leave any physical backups anywhere and had to carry the backups with me in an environment where loss of media was possible. There are a lot of files and an internet archive was not a realistic option.

Since I was backing up a lot if files, I wanted the program to do all the work of syncing the archive with the file system.

So, here is VaultSync as an open source project for the community.
